# Odin Project – Phase 2 Practice

This repository is part of my journey through **The Odin Project (TOP)**, focusing on learning Ruby through hands-on exercises.

## 🧠 What this repo contains
This folder includes simple Ruby practice scripts that demonstrate:
- Basic Ruby syntax (methods, arrays, loops, conditionals)
- Understanding how to use `git` and push code to GitHub
- Gradual mastery of Ruby fundamentals through practice

## 📂 Current Example: `user_roles.rb`
This file defines a small Ruby script that:
- Creates an array of users (each with a name and role)
- Iterates over each user using `.each`
- Uses conditionals (`if`, `elsif`, `else`) to describe what each user does
- Demonstrates basic Ruby structure, logic, and string interpolation

## ⚙️ Git Workflow Recap
1. `git init` – start a local Git repo  
2. `git add .` – stage your files  
3. `git commit -m "Add user_roles example script"` – save your progress  
4. Create a repo on GitHub  
5. Link it:
